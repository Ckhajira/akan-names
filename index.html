        <h1>AKAN NAME</h1>
        <p>The Akan population of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the
            order in which they were born.

            These names are derived from the Ghananian culture.

            This is an application that will calculate the day of the week that someone was born depending on their
            date of
            birth and give them an akan name based on their gender.</p>
        <p>Please select your gender:</p>

        <form onsubmit="return getName()">
            <label for="male">Male</label>
            <input id="male-entry" type="radio" name="gender" value="male" class="male-styling">

            <label for="female">Female</label>
            <input id="female-entry" type="radio" name="gender" value="female">
